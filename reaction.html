                    <h3>July 27, 1794 </h3>
                    <h3>The Thermidorian Reaction</h3>
                    <p><br />It marked a significant shift away from the radical excesses of the Reign of Terror and the authoritarian rule of the Jacobins. 
                        A parliamentary revolt against Maximilien Robespierre and the practices of the Committee of Public Safety. 
                        After a threatening speech by Robespierre, members of the National Convention decreed his arrest and were 
                        able to execute him and other leaders of the Jacobin party. This law, proposed by Maximilien Robespierre and supported by the 
                        Committee of Public Safety, aimed to expedite the trials of suspected counter-revolutionaries by streamlining the 
                        judicial process and removing certain legal protections for the accused. Under the Law of 22 Prairial, 
                        the revolutionary tribunals were empowered to convict individuals based solely on suspicion and circumstantial 
                        evidence, without the need for substantial proof or defense. This resulted in a dramatic increase in the 
                        number of executions during the Reign of Terror, as thousands of people were swiftly condemned to death. However, the Law of 
                        22 Prairial also contributed to growing dissatisfaction and opposition to the radical policies of the Jacobin regime.  
                        <br />
                        This resulted in the end of the Reign of Terror 
                        and Jacobin clubs and reinstitution of the individual rights of the National Convention. 
                        This event paved the way for a more moderate phase of the Revolution, known as the Thermidorian Reaction, 
                        characterized by a relaxation of revolutionary fervor and a move towards political stability.
                        While the Thermidorian Reaction brought an end to the Reign of Terror and the radical phase of the Revolution, 
                        it also saw the emergence of new challenges and conflicts as different factions vied for power in post-revolutionary France.
