                <h3>Causes <br /> </h3>
                <p><br />The main causes of the French Revolution were due to the internal problems within France. 
                    Prior to the French Revolution, Louis XIV was king of France. Louis XIV was heavily involved in wars and spent a lot of money and resources to build up his military army. This left France in an economic crisis with a lot of debt owed to other countries, one in which King Louis XVI could not solve. King Louis XIV’s inability to find a solution to the country’s problems weakened the monarchy’s authority, handing most of its power to the clergy and the nobility. He could not address the people’s grievances and was too late in introducing reforms. He was easily manipulated and controlled by the clergy and nobility, who wrongfully used their authority to benefit themselves. 
                    <br />
                    Food shortages in France were rising and causing widespread famine and starvation. Many people were in poverty unable to overcome the struggle for food. Poor agricultural harvests and rising food prices due to inflation caused bread shortages. The government did not alleviate the suffering of the people.
                    <br />
                    The financial crisis that France was in due to wars, led to taxation among the poor. The clergy (1% of the population) and the nobility (2% of the population) maintained most of the power in France, leaving the rest of the population to suffer in social, economic, and political inequality. During Estates General meetings, each of the estates- clergy, nobility, and everyone else, got one vote. When Louis XVI called a meeting to raise taxes on the citizens, the clergy and nobility favored it, while the third estate (everyone else) was against it. However, because each of the estates only got one vote, and the first and second estates had similar interests, they always won the votes, leaving the third estate to suffer. French society had major social inequality. The clergy, nobility, and the king enjoyed their vast amounts of wealth, while the majority of the population had the burden of taxes and oppression.
                    <br />
                    Enlightenment ideas prior to the French Revolution also sparked many ideas of liberty and equality. The Enlightenment and its philosophers facilitated the ideas of equality throughout France, equal rights for all men.
