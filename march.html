                <h3>October 5, 1789 </h3>
                <h3>Women's March to Versailles</h3>
                <p><br />The Women's March to Versailles marked a significant turning point in the struggle for equality and social justice.
                    It was sparked by increasing bread prices, food shortages, and frustration of the political situation, so thousands of women (some men)
                    marched to the Palace of Versailles to demand action from King Louis XVI. The people were fueled by anger over the 
                    extravagance of the royal court, while the people were struggling to afford basic needs. There were rumors that Queen
                    Marie Antoinette was holding flour and not giving it to the people. They demanded not only bread, but also
                    sought to confront the king directly and hold him accountable for the nation's woes.
                    When they reached the palace, the marchers confronted the king and his court, expressing their grievances and demanding action. 
                    The intense pressure from the crowds eventually compelled Louis XVI to agree to return with them to Paris, effectively bringing the 
                    royal family under the revolutionary forces. 
                    <br />
                    The Women's March to Versailles demonstrated the power of popular protest and direct action in challenging authority.
                    The involvement of women highlighted their vital role in the revolutionary movement, and increased the demand for gender 
                    equality and political representation. It also accelerated the radicalization of the revolution, which eventually led to the 
                    downfall of the absolute monarchy. The relocation of the royal family to Paris effectively ended the isolation of the monarchy and 
                    brought them closer with revolutionary forces. It symbolized the power of action and social and economic tensions that
                    drove the revolution.
